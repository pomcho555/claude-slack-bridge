Run long Claude Code jobs from Slack and reply to them from your phone.

A mention starts a job; the bot runs `claude` headless on your machine and posts
the result back in the thread. **Replying in that thread continues the same
Claude session** (`--resume`), so you can keep the conversation going from your
iPhone while you're AFK.

```
iPhone (Slack) ──Socket Mode──► bridge (this app, on your home server) ──► claude CLI
        ▲                                                                      │
        └───────────────── result / reply posted to the thread ◄──────────────┘
```

One Slack thread = one Claude session. No public URL needed (Socket Mode uses an
outbound connection), so it runs fine from a home server.

## Why this

- **Drive Claude Code from your phone** — start, monitor, and continue long jobs from Slack while you're AFK.
- **Threads are sessions** — replying in a thread resumes the same Claude session (`--resume`) with full context.
- **No public URL** — Socket Mode dials out, so it runs safely from a home server behind NAT.
- **Single static binary** — one `cargo install`, no runtime, no daemon manager; pure Rust on tokio.
- **Allow-list gated** — only `ALLOWED_USERS` can trigger jobs on your host, with a configurable permission mode.
- **Notify *any* terminal job** — a Stop hook pings Slack when an ordinary local `claude` run finishes.
- **Hardened CI** — fmt/clippy/audit plus cargo-deny, Trivy, Syft (SBOM), and TruffleHog on every change.

## Install

```sh
cargo install slack-claude-bridge
```

This installs four binaries on your `PATH`:

| Binary | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `slack-claude-bridge` | the bridge — listens on Slack and runs jobs (main entry point) |
| `slack-claude-job` | run a local job and push its result to Slack |
| `slack-claude-notify` | push text into a Slack thread for an existing session |
| `slack-claude-stop-hook` | Claude Code Stop hook → auto-notify any session |

**Prerequisites:** the [`claude`](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code)
CLI on your `PATH`, and a Rust toolchain to run `cargo install` (see
[rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)).

## Setup

### 1. Create the Slack app

Go to <https://api.slack.com/apps> → **Create New App** → **From an app manifest**,
pick your workspace, and paste:

```yaml
display_information:
  name: Claude Code Bridge
features:
  bot_user:
    display_name: claude
    always_online: true
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - app_mentions:read
      - channels:history
      - groups:history
      - im:history
      - chat:write
      - files:write
settings:
  event_subscriptions:
    bot_events:
      - app_mention
      - message.channels
      - message.groups
      - message.im
  socket_mode_enabled: true
```

Then:

- **Install App** → copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-…`) → `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.
- **Basic Information → App-Level Tokens** → generate one with the
  `connections:write` scope → copy (`xapp-…`) → `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`.
- Invite the bot to a channel: `/invite @claude`.

### 2. Configure

**Nothing to do up front.** On its first run, `slack-claude-bridge` prompts you
for the required settings and writes them to
`~/.config/claude-slack-bridge/config.toml` (created `0600`). Skip straight to
[Run](#3-run) and let it walk you through setup.

**Prefer to set it yourself?** Provide the values as environment variables, or
write `config.toml` by hand:

```toml
# ~/.config/claude-slack-bridge/config.toml
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN = "xoxb-…"       # from "Install App"
SLACK_APP_TOKEN = "xapp-…"       # the connections:write app-level token
ALLOWED_USERS = "U0123ABCD"      # your Slack user ID(s), comma-separated
CLAUDE_WORKDIR = "/path/to/repo" # the repo you want Claude to work in
```

Settings are resolved in this order (first one set wins): **environment
variable → `config.toml`**. The first-run prompt is skipped when there's no
terminal (e.g. the Stop hook), which falls back to environment variables
silently.

> ⚠️ Anyone allowed to trigger the bot can run Claude Code on your machine with
> the configured permission mode. Set `ALLOWED_USERS`.

### 3. Run

Start the bridge:

```bash
slack-claude-bridge
```

On the **first run** with nothing configured, it walks you through setup and
saves a `config.toml` for next time:

```text
No config found — let's set up claude-slack-bridge.
Answers are saved to config.toml; press Enter to skip an optional field.

Slack bot token (xoxb-…): xoxb-…
Slack app token (xapp-…, for Socket Mode): xapp-…
Allowed Slack user IDs, comma-separated (recommended; empty = everyone): U0123ABCD
Default notify channel ID (e.g. C0123, optional): C0123ABCD
Claude working directory (optional, defaults to CWD): /path/to/repo

Saved configuration to ~/.config/claude-slack-bridge/config.toml
```

After that (or if you set env vars / `config.toml` in step 2) it starts straight
away. Leave it running on your home server while jobs execute.

## Usage

In a channel the bot is in:

```
@claude refactor the auth module and run the tests
```

It replies `🛠 Started…`, runs the job (minutes or hours), then posts `✅ Done`
with the result. To continue, just reply in that thread:

```
the tests still fail on login — look at session expiry
```

That resumes the same Claude session with full context. Long results are
attached as a file.

## Outbound: get pinged on Slack when a *local* job finishes

Often you start a long job from your terminal and just want to be notified — and
able to reply — when it finishes hours later. These binaries post a result to
Slack **and** seed the thread with the Claude session, so replying in that thread
(mention the bot) continues the same session via `--resume`.

Set a default target channel first (the bot must be a member) — in `config.toml`
or the environment:

```toml
# in ~/.config/claude-slack-bridge/config.toml
SLACK_NOTIFY_CHANNEL = "C0123ABCD"   # or pass --channel per call
```

### `slack-claude-job` — run a job and push its result

```bash
slack-claude-job "refactor the auth module and run the tests"
```

Runs the prompt headless (same runner the bridge uses) and, when done, posts the
result to Slack and seeds the thread. Options: `--channel`, `--workdir`, `--title`.

### `slack-claude-notify` — push text for an existing session

```bash
echo "done — all green" | slack-claude-notify --session <session-id>
```

Text comes from `--text`, `--file`, or stdin.

### Auto-notify any session with a Stop hook

To get the same notification from an *ordinary* `claude` run, wire
`slack-claude-stop-hook` into Claude Code's **Stop** hook. It reads the session
id + transcript from the hook payload, extracts this turn's final message
(polling past the transcript-flush race), and pushes it to Slack.

It is **opt-in**: it does nothing unless `CLAUDE_SLACK_NOTIFY` is truthy, so
ordinary interactive sessions stay quiet. Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "cd /path/to/bridge-dir && slack-claude-stop-hook"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then run the jobs you care about with the flag set:

```bash
CLAUDE_SLACK_NOTIFY=1 claude -p "run the full migration and verify"
```

The hook always exits 0 — a failure there never breaks your Claude session, so
when opted in (`CLAUDE_SLACK_NOTIFY` set) it logs any failure to **stderr** (tune
with `RUST_LOG`) instead of dying silently. It needs only `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and a
target channel — `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` is **not** required for the hook (that's only
for the Socket Mode bridge), so an env-var-only setup works:

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-… SLACK_NOTIFY_CHANNEL=C0123 CLAUDE_SLACK_NOTIFY=1 claude
```

`config.toml` is read from `~/.config/claude-slack-bridge/` regardless of the
working directory; run the hook from the bridge directory if you want it to share
the same `bridge.db` (so replies continue the same session). All four binaries
accept `--help` and `--version`.

## Handoff model — read this

The terminal `claude` (the interactive TUI) and Slack are **separate OS
processes**, and the bridge connects them as a *handoff*, not a live two-way
mirror:

- The Stop hook pushes a **snapshot** of the last assistant message at the end
  of a turn — it does not stream the live terminal conversation.
- A Slack reply runs `claude --resume` as a **fresh headless process**; it
  cannot inject input into a running TUI, so it never shows up in the terminal.
- The interactive TUI holds its conversation in memory and never re-reads the
  transcript, so it cannot see what the Slack side appended.

**Rule: once a job has been handed off to Slack, continue only in that Slack
thread — stop typing in the terminal session.** Driving the same Claude session
from both forks it (two heads writing one transcript); the bridge cannot prevent
this across processes. Repeated Stop-hook pushes for the *same* session are
collapsed into the one existing thread, but a real fork (terminal + Slack both
active) is still a fork.

## Notes & limitations

- Per-thread worker threads are kept for the process lifetime — fine for personal
  use; for many threads you'd want to reap idle ones.
- Set `CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE=bypassPermissions` only if you fully trust the
  allowed users — it lets Claude run tools without prompting.
- `CLAUDE_TIMEOUT` (default 4h) kills runaway jobs.
